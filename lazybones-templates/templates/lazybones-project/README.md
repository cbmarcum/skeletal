Lazybones Template Project
--------------------------

You have just created a simple project for managing your own Lazybones project
templates. You get a build file (`build.gradle`) and a directory for putting
your templates in (`templates`).

To get started, simply create new directories under the `templates` directory
and put the source of the different project templates into them. You can then
package them all together or individually and publish them at a `file` or `http(s)` 
URL or install them into your local Skeletal cache directory.

You'll then be able to use Skeletal to create new projects from these templates.

You can find out more about creating templates in the [Template Developers Guide][1] 
and more about publishing templates in repositories in Skeletal project [README][2].
