== Introduction

This is a companion document to the https://cbmarcum.github.io/skeletal/template-developers-guide.html[Template Developer's Guide] to help describe a template developer's workflow 
when creating templates as there will be many iterations of changes and testing.

The main purpose is to keep these instructions out of the guide as they would be 
used multiple times throughout.

The examples will follow the projects used in the guide.

== Basic Steps

. Install the template to the Skeletal template cache.
. Create a test project from the template.
. Review the project files.
. Run tests.
. Build a distribution.
. Run the application.

== Installing a Template in Cache
When templates are first used from a repository they are copied to the Skeletal 
cache `$HOME/./skeletal/templates` but you can install them directly with the 
`installTemplate<template name>` task from `my-lzb-templates`

.gradle installTemplate* task
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew installTemplateSimpleJavaSpockGradle
----

== Creating a Test Project
Use the installed `simple-java-spock-gradle` version `0.1.0` template to create 
a `my-java-app` project with group `net.codebuilders`, archiveId `java-app`, and 
version `1.0-SNAPSHOT`. We used the script binding variable `artifactId` for 
the project name in `lazybones.groovy` and used that for the archive name and 
application command in the template. From a directory to create a test project in:

.create command
[source,bash]
----
skeletal create simple-java-spock-gradle 0.1.0 my-java-app -Pgroup=net.codebuilders -ParchiveId=java-app -Pversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

Note that you have to specify the version of the template to install, otherwise
Skeletal will look up the latest version online and either say the template
doesn't exist, or use whatever the latest version is (__not your development version__).

== Running Tests
The Gradle `check` task is a lifecycle task used to compile and run your unit and integration 
tests as well as any code style, vulnerability scans and other validation tasks you might have. 
If you only have unit tests this is the same as running `gradlew test`

Change to application directory and run tests:

.gradle check task
[source,bash]
----
cd my-java-app/

./gradlew check
----

You can see the test report in `app/build/reports/tests/test/index.html`

== Building and Running the Distribution
A distribution is your application and launch scripts packed in a `zip` or `tar` 
archive ready for distribution to users to unpack and use.

The `installDist` task will create an "installed" unpacked distribution within the 
build directory layout.

.gradle installDist task
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew installDist
----

Change directory into the distribution:

[source,bash]
----
cd app/build/install/java-app
----

Run the application using the `java-app` script.

.run application
[source,bash]
----
bin/java-app
Hello World!
----
== Cleaning Up
To prepare for more development and testing you can delete the test application 
and the template from the Skeletal cache.
