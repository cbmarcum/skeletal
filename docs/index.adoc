== Introduction

https://github.com/cbmarcum/skeletal[{app-name}] is a command line application that allows you to create a new project structure from a template.
Typically, templates are software project skeletons ready to add logic and compile, and can be of any software language or framework where a template is available.

{app-name} alone is just a tool that doesn't do much.
It needs a solid selection of template packages to make it a compelling
solution for developers' day-to-day needs.
That's why we try to make it as easy as possible to develop and publish templates.
This guide explains how to go about both steps.

Many software frameworks today have online configurators or command line applications 
to create skeleton projects. What many do not have is a subtemplate feature for 
adding more specific class types like controllers, services, etc. that you end up 
creating manually or copying from another project. Skeletal allows you to easily 
start with one of these framework skeletons and add more of your common code and 
create a more useful project template that can also contain subtemplates as well.

The project templates are simply directory structures with whatever files in
them that you want. Ultimately, the template project directories will be zipped
up and placed in a repository which is a directory at a URL (`file` or `http(s)`)
that contains a `skeletal-manifest.txt` with entries for each template version
available. From there, Skeletal downloads the zips on demand and caches them in
a local user directory (currently `$HOME/.skeletal/templates`).

Publishing templates previously included uploading the templates to your
Bintray account. Since Bintray is no longer available, Skeletal has replaced
this with creating a manifest file that contains the template metadata needed
by the command line application for listing template information. This manifest
file along with the template packages form a Simple URL based repository.
